		  <p>
		  <br>
		  
		  <font size="4">1. Slow Cadence</font>
		  
		  <br><br>
		  
		  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Running speed is a result of stride length multiplied by 
		  stride frequency. That said, many runners will first attempt 
		  to increase stride length, which in turn reduces their stride 
		  frequency, which, under optimal conditions should be around 180 
		  foot strikes per minute. The easiest way to count stride frequency
		  is to count your steps for 15 seconds and multiply by 4. If you count
		  40 steps in 15 seconds of running–meaning your are currently taking 
		  160 foot strikes per minute–gradually make the jump to 180 foot
		  strikes per minute by focusing on increasing your turnover.<br><br>
		  Take a few minutes to listen to your feet hit the pavement when you run.
		  The more time your feet spend on the ground, the more energy is required 
		  to propel it forward. Focus on increasing your cadence, and in turn, your
		  efficiency.

		  <br><br>
		  
		  <font size="4">2. Heel Striking</font>
		  
		  <br><br>
		  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Slow cadence often goes hand-in-hand with heel striking for many runners–or,
		  as I like to think of it, your hips are behind your feet. Imagine this: you 
		  cannot push off your foot when it is in front of your hips. Your hips must 
		  come over your feet in order to propel you forward.Arsenault argues that
		  “most people suffer from a poor sense of the relationship between timing 
		  of forward movement and foot contact on ground. This results in reaching 
		  the foot forward to land and pushing off too far from behind to propel.”<br><br>
          A lot of attention has been given to the barefoot and minimalist running movement. 
          Arthur Lydiard, one of the most well respected coaches of our time, encouraged
          minimalist footwear decades ago. Why? To avoid heel striking. One of the advantages
		  of running barefoot or in minimalist shoes is that it will hurt if you strike
		  with your heel. If someone asked you to sprint on pavement with little or 
		  nothing on your feet, you would likely run as you were intended to run. 
		  Try running on carpet, grass, or turf barefoot for short periods of 
		  time–20-seconds at first, working your way up to a minute or more, and 
		  let your body find its natural stride.
		  
		  <br><br>
		  
		  <font size="4">3. Lack of Mobility</font>
		  
		  <br><br>
		  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As mentioned earlier, stride frequency and stride length are the two 
		  components that determine running speed. Mobility trumps all else when it 
		  comes to running fast and staying healthy. If you lack complete range of 
		  motion anywhere in your lower body, you are going to be more susceptible
		  to injury.<br><br> A good way to increase running-specific mobility is through Active 
		  Isolated Stretching, a method made popular by stretching guru Phil Wharton.
		  His techniques are focused on how to lengthen the muscles properly in order 
		  to prevent injury and improve performance.Lastly, lets take a look at momentum,
		  ideally of the forward variety. One of the best ways to establish forward
		  momentum is to lean from the ankles. This forward lean will also help you avoid 
		  running vertical miles. Keep your head as level as possible, and avoid bouncing 
		  up and down as you propel yourself forward.
		  
		  <br><br>
		  
		  <font size="4">4. Unrelaxed Upper Body</font>
		  
		  <br><br>
		  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One of the most difficult things to teach a runner, beginner or experienced, 
		  is how to run fast AND relaxed. A good way to do this is by using the example
		  of a world-class sprinter. If you slow the footage down, you will see how 
		  relaxed his or her jaw is, how effortlessly their knees drive up toward and 
		  through the hips, and how the shoulders are relaxed and hanging away from 
		  the ears. Here are a few tips to ensure that your upper body is relaxed and 
		  you are carrying your arms properly. <br><br>* Keep the angle of your elbows at 90 
		  degrees, and be sure not to release that angle in the back swing, as it will 
		  only waste precious energy. <br><br>* Raise your shoulders to your ears at each mile 
		  marker during a race, and then drop them back down into their ideal, relaxed 
		  position.  <br><br>* Perform the “Hands on Head” drill. Start by interlocking your
		  hands on your head. Focus on keeping your core solid and straight while keeping 
		  the hips and shoulders level and relaxed. Start jogging. This drill will help 
		  you to eliminate any left to right movement through the hips and help eliminate
		  a criss-crossing, side-to-side arm carriage.
		  
		  <br><br>
		  
		  <font size="4">5. Not Running Fast</font>
		  
		  <br><br>
		  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;University of Colorado cross country and track coach Mark Wetmore, who said: 
		  “Distance doesn’t kill speed, not doing speed kills speed.” So what’s the easiest
		  and most effective way to work on your speed? <br><br>Start by performing a few strides 
		  after your easy runs, or add a session of weekly hill sprints into your schedule.
		  It’s hard to run fast, especially uphill, with inefficient form. From there, 
		  start sprinkling some small doses of speedwork into your training schedule,
		  which will help fine-tune your form, while improving speed and efficiency.
